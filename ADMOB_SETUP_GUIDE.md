## üíµ **Step 4: Revenue Optimization**

### **Strategic Ad Placement**

**Banner Ads (Continuous Revenue):**
- Bottom of market screen ‚úÖ (already placed)
- Bottom of portfolio screen ‚úÖ (already placed)
- Settings screen

**Interstitial Ads (High Revenue):**
- After completing 5 trades
- When switching between major sections
- After unlocking achievements

**Rewarded Ads (Best Engagement):**
- "Watch ad for $500 bonus cash"
- "Watch ad to unlock premium theme"
- "Watch ad for trading tips"

### **Revenue Maximization Tips**

**1. Optimal Ad Frequency:**
```dart
// Show interstitial every 3-5 minutes of active use
// Show rewarded ads on user request only
// Keep banner ads always visible (but not intrusive)
```

**2. User Experience Balance:**
```dart
// Never interrupt active trading
// Show ads during natural breaks
// Offer value for rewarded ads
```

## üìä **Step 5: Revenue Tracking**

### **Monitor Performance**
```
AdMob Console ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí View Reports
- Impressions (ad views)
- Clicks (user interactions)
- Estimated Earnings
- eCPM (earnings per 1000 impressions)
```

### **Revenue Analytics**
Your app now tracks:
- Ad clicks and revenue events
- User engagement with ads
- Ad performance by type

## üí∞ **Expected Revenue**

### **Realistic Estimates (US users):**
```
Banner Ads: $0.50 - $2.00 per 1000 impressions
Interstitial Ads: $1.00 - $5.00 per 1000 impressions  
Rewarded Ads: $3.00 - $10.00 per 1000 impressions
```

### **Monthly Revenue Calculation:**
```
1000 active users √ó 10 sessions/month √ó 2 ads/session = 20,000 ad impressions
20,000 impressions √ó $2 average eCPM = $40/month

10,000 active users = $400/month potential
100,000 active users = $4,000/month potential
```

## üöÄ **Step 6: Advanced Monetization**

### **Rewarded Features to Add:**
```dart
// Bonus cash for watching ads
static void offerBonusCash() {
  RevenueAdMobService.showRewardedAd(
    onReward: (reward) {
      // Give user $500 bonus cash
      UserService.addBonusCash(500);
    }
  );
}

// Premium themes via ads
static void unlockPremiumTheme() {
  RevenueAdMobService.showRewardedAd(
    onReward: (reward) {
      // Unlock premium theme
      ThemeService.unlockPremiumTheme();
    }
  );
}
```

### **A/B Testing Ideas:**
- Different ad frequencies
- Various reward amounts
- Ad placement optimization
- Theme unlock strategies
