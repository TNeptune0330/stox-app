## ü§ñ Android Setup & Signing

### Step 1: Create Keystore

```bash
# Navigate to your app directory
cd /Users/takshpradhan/stox-app/stox

# Create keystore (DO THIS ONCE - KEEP SAFE!)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/stox-release-key.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias stox-key

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (REMEMBER THIS!)
# - Key password (can be same as keystore)
# - Your name/organization details
```

### Step 2: Configure Gradle Signing

1. **Create key.properties file**
   ```bash
   # Create android/key.properties (DON'T COMMIT TO GIT!)
   echo "storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
   keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
   keyAlias=stox-key
   storeFile=$HOME/stox-release-key.keystore" > android/key.properties
   ```

2. **Update android/app/build.gradle**
   ```gradle
   # Add before android block:
   def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
   def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
   if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
       keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
   }

   android {
       ...
       signingConfigs {
           release {
               keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
               keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
               storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
               storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
           }
       }
       buildTypes {
           release {
               signingConfig signingConfigs.release
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Build Signed APK/AAB

```bash
# Build signed APK for testing
flutter build apk --release

# Build signed App Bundle for Play Store
flutter build appbundle --release

# Files will be in:
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
# build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Step 4: Google Play Console Setup
